since happycasts stress on  problem-centered and "get the probem solved", so I will this time talk about github workflow, rather than git-rebase. git-rebase will be used just as a sligtly nicer way than git-pull.
but happycasts can also be tool-centered, so I may give a overview to git-rebase as well. 

1. when someone pulled before you, and there is no conflicts
    
    you can do either git pull or git rebase

    so people the steps, show people the end result, let people decide which one    they need, pull or rebase?

2. when someone pulled before you and there is conflicts

    you still can do both
    show people the merge tool, maybe

```terminal
sudo apt-get install meld
git config --global merge.tool meld
